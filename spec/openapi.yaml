    Esper Manage APIs for Cloud are a set of REST-based APIs that help you programmatically control and monitor your enterprise's dedicated Esper endpoint. Using these APIs, one can orchestrate & manage devices that have been provisioned against your endpoint. Furthermore, this API allows you to manage android applications that get installed on such devices. To read more about the various capabilities of Esper endpoints and Esper managed devices, please visit esper.io.
    This guide describes all the available APIs in detail, along with code samples for you to quickly ramp up to using them.

    {
      "errors": [],
      "message": "error message",
      "status": 400
    }

      ```bash

          curl -X GET \
            https://DOMAIN.shoonyacloud.com/api/enterprise/<enterprise_id>/device/ \
            -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      ```

      > Please note the use of keyword **Bearer** before the token value.
